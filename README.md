# CryptoPalChallenges
Matasano (or NCC Group) cryptopals.com challenges. Solutions written in c#. These challenges are used for learning only.
I had a lot of fun doing these challenges and I learned a lot, not only about cryptography. I really advise taking a run through these challenges if you have any interest in cryptography and how it works in practice. It can be quite challenging to get through all of these, especially if (like me) you have no background in cryptography.

I turned the notes I made while doing these challenges into a book, which you can find at https://www.gitbook.com/book/rorymurphyza/cryptopals-challenges/details if you get stuck on anything.

Have fun and please let me know if you are stuck on any of the solutions or if you have a better solution to one of the challenges than me. There is nothing better than learning from eachother.
